# Patient Readmission Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing patient readmission data to identify patterns and relationships in the data that can help predict the likelihood of patient readmission to the hospital. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning steps.

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze patient readmission data from a hospital to predict if a patient will be readmitted. The analysis covers:
- Data loading and understanding
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns
- Statistical tests to identify associations between features
- Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict readmission

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes several features such as:
- `age`: The patient's age.
- `glucose_test`: Results of glucose tests.
- `A1Ctest`: Results of A1C tests.
- `medical_specialty`: The medical specialty assigned to the patient.
- `readmitted`: A binary target variable indicating if the patient was readmitted.

## Data Preprocessing

This step includes loading the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves visualizing the data to uncover trends, relationships, and distributions. We create graphs like bar charts and pie charts to better understand the variables and how they relate to readmission.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical tests, like the chi-square test, are performed to understand the associations between features and readmission. This step helps determine which factors significantly affect patient readmission.

## Results & Interpretation

This section summarizes the performance of the models, compares different models' results, and interprets the findings from the statistical tests.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis and model results, conclusions are drawn about the factors influencing patient readmission. This can help improve hospital operations and reduce unnecessary readmissions.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required for this project:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
